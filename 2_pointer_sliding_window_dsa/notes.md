# 2-Pointer and Sliding Window

- In these problems, we use two pointer 'left' and 'right' over the array of elements of characters within a given string.
- And we expand the 'right' pointer and shrink the 'left' pointer to adjust the window size.
- We keep tracking for maxLength or minLength depending on conditions.
